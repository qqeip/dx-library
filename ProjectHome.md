# DX.Library Overview #
DX.Library contains various helpers and utilities for Delphi, with a special focus on cross platform development.
All code is tested with Delphi XE4 only.

With Delphi XE4 Embarcadero opened Delphi to support mobile devices. They built a new "NextGen" compiler to support ARM devices such as the iPhone and later Androids.

The RTL and FireMonkey were massively expanded to support this new compiler and the cross platform scenario. There is still room for utilities though that make your life easier. This is where DX.Library jumps in.

Our current focus is on iOS, we will keep in mind though, that there are more platforms to support sooner or later. Specifically the included DX.RREST.Client.pas unit is already fully supported under Windows and iOS.

Be aware that the code is in flux. We try to keep breaking changes to a bare minimum, but as the iOS platform is new to Delphi, there might be future changes.
